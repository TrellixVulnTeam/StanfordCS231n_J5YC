# StanfordCS231n
This project for studying StanfordCS231n will be finished by 2 monthes ,maybe more.

The project StanfordCS231n is managed by anaconda, therefore, the dictionary tree is structured by conda style and the results will be found in folder "Script".

Python files in Script including scripts with "classification" prefix are programmed by master and represent normal NN Classifier, KNN Classifier, respectively as D_, K_.

All algorithms are designed by course and a little bit of my mind.
